### Data Exploration
SQL Query - [Data Exploration](https://github.com/hainguyendtx/Customer-Sales-Analysis---eCommerce/blob/main/Data%20Exploration.sql)  

Prior to cleaning data, we will explore our data sets.   

Observations:  
1. Table below shows all column names and data types. The __Customer_id__ column is the primary key.  

   ![image](https://github.com/hainguyendtx/Customer-Sales-Analysis---eCommerce/assets/157367308/a2e19bcf-30de-435b-9c96-773e53399fb9)

    - __Time_Spent__ and __Purchase_DATE__ needs to be converted to their proper format. 

2. Following table shows number of __null values__ in for each column.

### Data Cleaning
SQL Query: [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/hainguyendtx/Customer-Sales-Analysis---eCommerce/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning.sql)  
1. __Time_Spent__ column is used to convert into time format by adding a new column named __Time_Spent_Converted__.
2. __Purchase_DATE__ converted to YYYY-MM-DD format.
3. All numerical representation are replaced with their appropriate attributes named.
4. Added a new column called __Season__ by using __Purchase_DATE__ for seasonal analysis. (January-Feb = Winter, March-May = Spring, June-August = Summer, September-November = Autumn)
5. Added an __Age_Group__ column for demographics analysis

- Insights

   - Across all age groups, there are twice as many females as there are males. The clientele and revenue generation from clientele predominantly comprised of middle-aged adults (40-59). Following Middle-Aged adults, Adults aged 25-39 constitute the second-largest demographic. Young Adults (18-24) are also part of the customer base, ranking third in terms of revenue contribution. Seniors (60+) represent the fourth largest group, while Teenagers (16-18) make up a much smaller portion of the customer base.

- Insights

   - The purchasing behaviors across different gender demographics show almost identical patterns, with minimal differences observed. Whether it pertains to the choice of payment method, web browser preferences, subscription status, or voucher usage, the distinctions are negligible. Notably, our customer base predominantly utilizes Chrome browsers, accounting for approximately 64% of users, followed by Safari, while other browsers like Edge are the least preferred with around 5% of users, with the rest using other browsers. In terms of payment methods, around 30% of customers opt for cards, with digital wallets and PayPal each constituting roughly 29% of transactions, while the remainder utilizes other payment methods.

   - There's minimal variance in revenue generation between each season, typically fluctuating only within a range of $1000 to $5000. However, a subtle trend emerges: revenue generation among males peaks during autumn and is the lowest during winter, while for females, the pattern is reversed, with highest revenue during winter and lowest during autumn. As for spring and summer, they're almost the same, only fluctuating within a range of $400 to $1000 for both gender.

4. Last, we'll look at revenue generation for each payment method to determine a possible ways to optimize the checkout process.

# Act

- Since card and digital wallets contribute significantly to revenue, incentivize customers to use these payment methods by offering discounts, cashback, or loyalty rewards.
- While card and digital wallets are popular, consider expanding payment options to cater to a wider range of customer preferences. Explore partnerships with emerging payment platforms or offer alternative payment methods to attract more customers.
